Arch Linux on a MacBook Pro 9.2
================================

gathered information and installed Arch on a MacBook:

Some boot keycodes:
Hold alt while booting to display the startup manager (you can select your boot device here).
Hold ctrl while selecting a boot device (choose your EFI partition) to permanently boot from that one.
Hold cmd+R while starting to start a recovery. If you have a OS X recovery partition, this is a recovery wizard (restore from time machine, reinstall OS X, disk utility). If you donâ€™t, it starts a complete internet recovery ((almost?) restore factory defaults). It even restores your EFI NVRAM thingy, I think.
